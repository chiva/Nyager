Nyaner
======

Nyaner brings the best of *Nyan Cat* and *Jasager*.

[*Jasager*](http://www.digininja.org/jasager/) fools wifi cards making them think that the router is an already known one (for example the one at your home), so they connect automatically without asking permission to.

Once connected, all DNS querys are redirected to the *Nyan Cat* page inside the router, so it is fully auto-contained as no internet connection is required.


Installation
------------

**NOTE:** This has only been tested with a *Fonera 2201* router.

Installation steps:

1. Flash Jasager firmware
2. SCP files to router
3. Run install script
4. Have fun!

It would be nice to remove current flash dependencies
